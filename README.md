Click the add animal button to add a new animal to the array.
Click any of the gifs that appear, and they'll animate, click em again and theyll stop moving.

eliminate the pg-13 tag within the api key for some fun if you dare! Just erase this code: (&rating=pg-13)
or play with the limit= in your browser window to change number of gifs imported for the chosen animal
